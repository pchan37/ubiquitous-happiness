       Worked on pet route. It is now working, so there is no more need to do some db fixing. I just need Celine to do some CSS magic now.
kevinZ -- 2017-01-14 7:55 PM
       Fixed the issue with Pets table not being created. It was because the command was not being executed.

       Fixed bug with the communication between client and server
patrickC -- 2017-01-24 09:50 AM
       Fixed case-insensitive matching
       Fixed fuzzy matching component (return data that starts with a 's' when you type 's')
       Inserted parenthesis so that querying for multiple pieces of data works
       Note: Need to refactor/rewrite the codebase (it's a huge mess right now)
       Need to fix the rendering of the new data along with fix the errors when retrieving data in columns other than name
patrickC -- 2017-01-24 11:00 AM
       Managed to get the client-side to render new data (very hacky, need to pull thoughts from team)
       Note: Need to rewrite the codebase (it's a huge mess right now)
       Note: Need to "reset" the data rendered when user reset the form to original state
patrickC -- 2017-01-24 12:00 PM
       Got the dateLost field to work
       Fixed path to static content for all templates
       Did some refactoring to the codebase for a somewhat cleaner codebase
       Note: Need to "reset" the data rendered when user reset the form to original state
